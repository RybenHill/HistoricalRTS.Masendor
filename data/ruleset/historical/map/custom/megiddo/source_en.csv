0,"Modern Historians","20,000 vs 15,000",0,1,1,0,"Modern Historians, and their scientific guess seem to conclude that both Egyptian and Canaanite armies were numbered at around 10,000 for both sides with Egyptian at the advantage. The Egyptian fielded their armies with both professional and mercenary troops from all over Levant and Nubia, while the Canaanites gathered their armies from their militias and nearby allied tribes."
1,"Egyptian ","Need to read some sources again",0,1,1,0,"Similar to any other ancient battle, the record of Battle of Megiddo was written by the victor that is the Ancient Egyptian in the Temple of Amun-Reâ€™s hieroglyph wall. Almost like a tradition, the Egyptian source also gave the number advantage to the enemy to glorify the Pharoah's victory. Seeing that it is the only record left in the present, maybe the Egyptians were truthful about the recount after all? Why would they lie if they believe they have to pass through the Hall of Maat in the afterlife, right?"
2,"Spalinger","5,000 vs 2,000",0,0.3,0.1,0,"Anthony J. Spalinger provides a more conservative estimation of the size of both armies in his book based on the Egyptian record of war spoils obtained from the plunder of the Canaanite war camp at roughly a thousand horses and two thousand chariots. Then the size of Aruna Pass which the Egyptian army traversed to reach Meggido can only support a small marching rank. Hence, the ten thousand numbers on both sides are unlikely."
3,"Nelson","15,000 vs 10,000",0,1,1,0,"Harold H. Nelson estimates the size of both armies somewhat conservatively in his PhD dissertation and book at around 10,000 troops on both sides, with the Egyptian fielded a larger force. Both forces fielded roughly a 10-to-1 distribution ratio between infantries and chariots."
