"Class","Description"
"Melee Infantry","Melee infantry is the barebone of ancient warfare that can be used for all types of role. Most of the time, such unit is the deciding factor in not only battle but the war itself. Never underestimate even the lowest melee infantry and you will live long enough to be the master of the battlefield.  "
"Range Infantry","Range infantry may not yet be the dominant force in the past compare to the present time, it can still tip the scale of victory during the skirmish phase of the battle or in siege warfare. Typically weak in melee combat, it is not advisable to put them in the frontline unless the enemy is incapable of pulling a significant melee charge. "
"Range Cavalry","The greatest tool of the conquerors of the known world. Fast and vicious, range cavalry is an unmatched force in the flat plain. As long as they do not fight in unsuitable terrain or situation or engage in unfavourable melee combat, it is almost impossible to destroy them. "
"Light Cavalry","Light cavalry has many roles, either scouting, skirmishing, harassing or pursuing fleeing enemies. They are less suited for direct melee combat however, so use their superb mobility to avoid losing them in a pointless fight."
"Heavy Cavalry","Heavy or shock cavalry is the domination force in the old battlefield. Their charge can pierce through even shield wall. The only few downsides are that they are slower than lighter cavalry and much more difficult to employ in the field in large number."
"Chariot","Chariot used to be master of the battlefield before the invention of cavalry. Although less used now, their presence can still instil fear into the enemy while crushing through enemy squads. Chariot unit usually also carry range weapon with a good amount of ammunition, which make it a decent skirmish unit as well."
"Artillery","Artillery exists in many forms depending on its use. Some artilleries are more effective against infantry units such as scorpion or hwacha, while some others are more suitable for damaging structure or siege warfare likes trebuchet."
