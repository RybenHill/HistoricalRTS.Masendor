# Educational and historical wargame simulation made with [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame). 

There is no main name for the game but rather the name will be based on a major update.

# How to run/compile

If you want to download the release version to test the game, go to [Release](https://github.com/remance/Masendor/releases) tags and [**download**](https://github.com/remance/Masendor/releases/download/0.6.2.3/Dream.Decision.zip) the zip file. <br>

## Run
To start testing the game run `main.py` via Python interpreter for the source code or `main` file directly for the release version. <br>

## System Requirements

### MINIMUM:

OS: Windows 7 (Haven't tested on Windows XP or Vista but may work), Ubuntu ad macOS need further testing

Memory: 2GB RAM (Only if troop animation is disabled)

Processor: Need more testing

Graphics: Need more testing

Storage: Currently 400 MB but likely around 1 GB available space in finished version.

### RECOMMEND:

OS: Windows 8, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS Monterey

Memory: 4GB RAM

Processor: Need more testing

Graphics: Need more testing

Storage: 1GB available space

## Compile
To compile the source code into an executable program, recommend using pyinstaller and `main.spec`. <br>
The `main.spec` compile only `main.py`, so you will need to copy gamescript, data, profile folder manually to the dist folder after.
Additionally, the spec file also include animation maker, but you will also need to copy animation maker folder to the dist folder to make it functional.

Check the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file for dependency requirements if running with the python source code.<br>
Also, the game is now optimised based on the pygame 2.1.2 module and python 3.10. (may have to use cython later for a huge size battle)

# Latest Update

# Key features so far

## History is told by the victor, but sometimes the words of the loser do not fade away

> 14th October 1066 AD, Duke William of Normandy’s force arrived at Telham Hill early in the morning, while Harold Godwinson’s force was already positioned at Senlac Ridge. It is believed that Harold intent to ambush William's army at their camp and was surprised by William's arrival at Telham Hill.

> 14th October 1066 AD, King Harold Godwinson intercepted William the Bastard’s force at Senlac Ridge, Hastings. The rightful king of England refused to cover in a castle before the pretender and bravely marched his army to crush the enemy head-on.

Have you ever find it weird that most historical games follow only a specific version of the story? Even a single battle may have more than one side of the story.<br>
For example, the Normans say they are the underdog in the Battle of Hastings, while the Saxons also say they are the underdog.<br>
Well in this game, all versions of the story are accepted and represented. Every preset historical map will have more than 1 source of information that dictates the story tone, army composition, size, even formation and possibly more.

## Army is led by more than just a king

So many historical war games have only one leader per army. Not here. Every unit has a leadership structure and every historical battle will have all the named people that participated in the battle.

## Custom Unit Creator

Bored of a simple line formation and want to try making weird unit formation? There is a custom unit editor that provides a complete freedom unit design. The custom units can be used in custom battles.

## Extremely easy map creation

Most of the strategy map creator requires a degree of learning to use effectively. Well in this game you just need to use MS Paint or any drawing software ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), etc.) to create a map.<br>
Draw the image with the right colour set and the game will convert them into a playable map. Most other map functions are also very easy to create and modify.

## Encyclopedia and stuff

This game's encyclopedia will have more information than just from the Wikipedia website as long as they can be found that is.

This function is going to be a headache to write and research. But hopefully, it will provide useful and interesting historical information to players.

---------------

For those who have read this far, thank you for your interest in the game. To be honest, every single update begins with how do I even start with this.<br>
I start developing this game with zero knowledge in video game development let alone how to use pygame. I start learning how to use pygame by tinkering with alien.py in pygame examples folder and keep testing/changing it until it becomes what you can see right now (I keep most video updates on youtube which show the progress of improvement almost from the start). All of the plan I list for the future is the same. I have no idea how to do it, the only thing I have is the picture of what I want to make it look like. Nevertheless, it is fun figuring stuff out and don't let the lack of knowledge stop you from making your own game :P.
